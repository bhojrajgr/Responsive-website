##  Installation & Running Locally

1. **Clone the repo**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhojrajgr/Responsive-website.git
    ```

2. **Open the project folder**  
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or file explorer.

3. **Open `index.html`**  
    You can open it directly in your browser or use a local development server for live editing:
    ```bash
    # With VS Code:
    code .
    ```
    Then install and use the Live Server extension, or:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

##  Responsiveness Strategy

- **Viewport meta tag** ensures proper scaling on mobile:
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ```

- **Media queries** define breakpoints (e.g., 480px, 768px, 1024px) for layout shifts.

- **Fluid grids & flexible units** (like `%, vw, rem`) make components adapt to screen size.

- **Responsive images** using `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` ensure images scale properly.
